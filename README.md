**â˜• Powering the Next `int $0x13`?**

Most of my time is spent either fine-tuning interfaces or reverse-engineering the weird and wonderful bits of software. It's all part of the fun, and fueled by curiosity (and caffeine).

If you liked something I made or just want to support the ongoing tinkering, a virtual coffee is always appreciated!
