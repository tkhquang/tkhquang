**â˜• Powering the Next `int $0x13`?**

My dev life often feels a bit like that script: toggling between the `day_op_engage` (making interfaces) and the `night_op_engage` (puzzling over compiled code). And yes, sometimes caffeine levels are indeed critical for that mental context switch!

If you enjoy this "Pixel Crafter, Binary Decoder" approach, find my adventures in frontend or reverse engineering interesting, or just want to support the ongoing quest to "Shine the UI, then x-ray the binary," a virtual coffee is a fantastic way to help fuel the next `Recharge` routine.

No obligation at all, of course, but your support is super appreciated and keeps the tinkering spirit alive!
